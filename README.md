# Personalize It Web App

## About The Project
![Product Name Screen Shot](./client/public/screenshot.png)

This web application allows users to create, customize, and manage their own custom cars. By selecting different features like model, color, engine type, and interior, users can build a car that fits their preferences. The app dynamically updates the total price as users select their desired features, providing a real-time car-building experience.

- **Real-Time Price Calculation**: The price of the car updates dynamically based on selected features.
- **Comprehensive Feature Options**: The app allows customization from a wide variety of models, colors, engine types, and interior options.
- **Data Persistence**: Users can create cars, view a list of submitted custom cars, and even edit or delete them from the interface.
