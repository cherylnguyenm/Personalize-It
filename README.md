## About The Project

This web application allows users to create, customize, and manage their own custom cars. By selecting different features like model, color, engine type, and interior, users can build a car that fits their preferences. The app dynamically updates the total price as users select their desired features, providing a real-time car-building experience.

- **Real-Time Price Calculation**: The price of the car updates dynamically based on selected features.
- **Comprehensive Feature Options**: The app allows customization from a wide variety of models, colors, engine types, and interior options.
- **Data Persistence**: Users can create cars, view a list of submitted custom cars, and even edit or delete them from the interface.
